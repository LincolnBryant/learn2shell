What to do when your screen gets messed up?
	- clear
	- reset

Cat's evil twin: 'tac'
	also 'rev'

repeat the last command:
	- !!

make a bunch of files/directories at once using expansion:
	mkdir {kittens,puppies,piglets}

search your history:
	ctrl-r

shell navigation:
	ctrl-a -> beginning of line
	ctrl-e -> end of line

modes:
	by default, the shell is in 'emacs mode'
	you can switch it over to 'vi' mode with:
		$ set -o vi	

job control: 
	ctrl-z to send the 'stop' signal

long running processes:
	use 'screen'
	ctrl-z, jobs, disown %1

change your prompt:
	echo $PS1
	export PS1=[yourchangeshere]		

Fire off packets to arbitrary remote hosts
	echo "foo" > /dev/tcp/[hostname]/port
	- can also do UDP!
